This is Connect4 built in Ruby and playable from the command line.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

First Commit - Primary functionality has been achieved. The game runs as expected but the code itself could be refactored. In particular, the code responsible for determining if a player has made a diagonal Connect4 is somewhat repetitive as I have designed it to check 'above_left', 'below_right, 'below_left' and 'above_right' in 4 seperate but similar methods. My objective now is to consolidate these methods into one which handles such a scenario.
